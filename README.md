# Bundle for Racial Justice and Equality (brje) Game Wheel
(The Bundle in question)[https://itch.io/b/520/bundle-for-racial-justice-and-equality] is AWESOME. But 1600+ games is ALOT. So to make the bundle more interactive here's a Game Wheel. It will select a random game from the bundle to play.

Obviously you could get fancy and turn this into a flash app with a button and some filters, or just a cute little QT pop-up, or a pygame based spinner. Whatever makes your streams more fun. Enjoy the games (I know I will!)

*special thanks to itch.io for putting up the bundle to support the fight for Racial Justice and Equality - and to all the developers who put
their games in the bundle !!!!!!*
